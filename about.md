Hi, my name is Aurélien Schelcher. I'm a mobile app development engineer currently working [@UbiTransport](http://www.ubitransport.com). I'm also passonate about web development as well as embedded development on little cardboard like Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Curious by nature, I like to stay up to date with all new stuff coming out every day. I'm a fan of agile methodologies and development principles like SOLID, MVP and other TDD.
